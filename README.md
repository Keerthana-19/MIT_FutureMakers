  Through this program, I hope to explore and gain hands-on experience with more complex AI algorithms such as those that analyze human emotion and behavior.

  Participating in Dr. David Kong's seminar gave me the opportunity to both develop my own story and immerse myself in the journeys of my peers. It was fascinating to see how everyone had an engaging personal experience to share despite initial concerns that our stories may not be as impressive as the sample videos we watched. It also inspired me to look for issues in my own community that I can take a stand against as a supportive and visionary leader.
