  Through this program, I hope to explore and gain hands-on experience with more complex AI algorithms such as those that analyze human emotion and behavior.

  Participating in Dr. David Kong's seminar gave me the opportunity to both develop my own story and immerse myself in the journeys of my peers. It was fascinating to see how everyone had an engaging personal experience to share despite initial concerns that our stories may not be as impressive as the sample videos we watched. It also inspired me to look for issues in my own community that I can take a stand against as a supportive and visionary leader.

  1) What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?
      - Supervised learning models predict classes or values based on a dataset with predetermined labels while unsupervised models cluster unlabeled data into a specified number of groups by similarity.

  2) Describe why the following statement is FALSE: Scikit-Learn has the power to visualize data without a Graphviz, Pandas, or other data analysis libraries.
      - Scikit-Learn is focused on data modelling and not data visualization, so it relies on other libraries such as Graphviz to fill this gap.

  **Issue:** Mismanagement of waste due to the placement of trash items in the wrong bins can have dangerous consequences for our natural environment.
  
  **Dataset:** https://www.kaggle.com/techsash/waste-classification-data
  
  **Model:** A convolutional neural network would be the best model to choose for this situation, since it could be used to analyze a photo taken of the user's trash item and identify which bin it should be placed in.

  1) What are “Tensors” and what are they used for in Machine Learning?
      - Tensors are multidimensional data arrays. They are used in Machine Learning to represent data and transformations of higher dimensions.

  2) What did you notice about the computations that you ran in the TensorFlow programs (i.e. interactive models) in the tutorial?
      - Running models in TensorFlow often requires preprocessing of the data to ensure that there is no bias towards certain categories or distracting features that may lower accuracy.
