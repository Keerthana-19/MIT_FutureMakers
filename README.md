  Through this program, I hope to explore and gain hands-on experience with more complex AI algorithms such as those that analyze human emotion and behavior.

  Participating in Dr. David Kong's seminar gave me the opportunity to both develop my own story and immerse myself in the journeys of my peers. It was fascinating to see how everyone had an engaging personal experience to share despite initial concerns that our stories may not be as impressive as the sample videos we watched. It also inspired me to look for issues in my own community that I can take a stand against as a supportive and visionary leader.

  1) What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?
      - Supervised learning models predict classes or values based on a dataset with predetermined labels while unsupervised models cluster unlabeled data into a specified number of groups by similarity.

  2) Describe why the following statement is FALSE: Scikit-Learn has the power to visualize data without a Graphviz, Pandas, or other data analysis libraries.
      - Scikit-Learn is focused on data modelling and not data visualization, so it relies on other libraries such as Graphviz to fill this gap.

  **Issue:** Mismanagement of waste due to the placement of trash items in the wrong bins can have dangerous consequences for our natural environment.
  
  **Dataset:** https://www.kaggle.com/techsash/waste-classification-data
  
  **Model:** A convolutional neural network would be the best model to choose for this situation, since it could be used to analyze a photo taken of the user's trash item and identify which bin it should be placed in.

  1) What are “Tensors” and what are they used for in Machine Learning?
      - Tensors are multidimensional data arrays. They are used in Machine Learning to represent data and transformations of higher dimensions.

  2) What did you notice about the computations that you ran in the TensorFlow programs (i.e. interactive models) in the tutorial?
      - Running models in TensorFlow often requires preprocessing of the data to ensure that there is no bias towards certain categories or distracting features that may lower accuracy.

  1) How do you think Machine Learning or AI concepts were utilized in the design of this game?

     - A machine learning model was trained to mimic your hiring method based on your early hiring decisions.

  2) Can you give a real-world example of a biased machine learning model, and share your ideas on how you make this model more fair, inclusive, and equitable? Please reflect on why you selected this specific biased model.

     - Facial recognition models such as Face ID on Apple’s iPhone are biased in their identification of users’ faces. They are often trained on datasets that are heavily dominated by Caucasian features and, as a result, are less accurate in recognizing users of different ethnicities. To fix this issue, it is necessary for them to even out their training data distribution by adding more images from a variety of ethnicities.

  Convolutional neural networks reduce matrices to lower dimensions before performing operations while fully connected neural networks connect every neuron to each neuron in the layer after it. The convolutional layer performs operations on smaller sections of the input matrix while the pooling layer reduces the number of dimensions in the matrix. Convolutional networks are used when only specific features of an image need to be analyzed for recognition while fully connected networks are needed when the entirety of an input image must be analyzed.
